### 📊 **Why Reports and Dashboards?**

Salesforce data holds the answers to business questions like:

- Which products are top sellers?
    
- Who are the highest-value prospects?
    
- How successful are marketing campaigns?
    

**Admins** like Maria translate these questions into **reporting criteria** by:

1. Asking clarifying questions.
    
2. Defining requirements.
    
3. Mapping requirements to report filters, groupings, and types.

### 📋 **What Is a Report?**

- A **report** is a list of records that meet defined criteria.
    
- Reports can be **filtered, grouped**, and presented with **charts**.
    
- Each report lives in a **folder** with controlled access (public/private/shared).
    
- Example: A report on top-selling products grouped by family with a bar chart.

### 🧩 **What Is a Report Type?**

- A **report type** is like a **template** that defines which objects and fields you can report on.
    
- **Standard report types** cover common needs (e.g., Leads, Opportunities).
    
- **Custom report types** let you include specific related objects.
    
    - Example: “Leads with Activities” to only show leads with related activities.

### 📈 **What Is a Dashboard?**

- A **dashboard** is a visual display of report data using charts and graphs.
    
- Dashboards are made up of **widgets**, each tied to a source **report**.
    
- Like reports, they live in **folders** with controlled access.
    
- Dashboards have a **running user**:
    
    - Shows data based on that user's permissions.
        
    - Use **dynamic dashboards** to show data based on the viewer’s access.

### 🗂️ **Organize Reports & Dashboards**

- Stored in **folders** that control visibility:
    
    - **Public**, **private**, or **shared**.
        
    - Controlled by **roles, permissions, groups, or territories**.

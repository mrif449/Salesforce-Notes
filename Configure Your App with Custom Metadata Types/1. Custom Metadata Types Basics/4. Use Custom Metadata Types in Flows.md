## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you’ll be able to:

- ✅ Explain how to reference custom metadata in a Flow
    
- ✅ Use Flow Builder to access and apply metadata record data in automations

## 📋 Overview

You’ve already seen how to use custom metadata in formulas, default values, and validation rules. Now let’s automate business logic by using **Flows** to reference those same records.

### Use Case:

**Acme Services** wants to **automatically update an Account's Support Tier** to **Gold** when its spending passes the required threshold.

## ⚙️ Create a Flow That Uses Custom Metadata

### Step 1: Start a New Flow

1. Go to **Setup → Flows**
    
2. Click **New Flow**
    
3. Select:
    
    - **Start from Scratch**
        
    - **Record-Triggered Flow** → Click **Create**
        
4. For **Object**: `Account`
    
5. Configure the Trigger:
    
    - **Trigger When**: A record is created or updated
        
    - **Condition Requirements**: `Total_Spending__c IS CHANGED = True`
        
    - **Optimize Flow For**: Fast Field Updates
        

---

### Step 2: Get the Custom Metadata Record

1. Add an Element: **Get Records**
    
2. **Label**: `Get Support Tier Config`
    
3. Object: `Support_Tier__mdt`
    
4. Filter Conditions:
    
    - **MasterLabel = Gold**
        

This fetches the **Gold support tier** configuration (e.g., minimum spending requirement).

---

### Step 3: Update the Account Record

1. Add an Element: **Update Records**
    
2. **Label**: `Update Gold Account`
    
3. Choose: **Use the account record that triggered the flow**
    
4. Filter Conditions:
    
    - `Total_Spending__c >= [Minimum_Spending__c from Get Support Tier Config]`
        
5. Field Update:
    
    - **Field**: `Support_Tier__c`
        
    - **Value**: `Gold`
        

---

### Step 4: Save and Activate the Flow

1. Click **Save**
    
2. Name your flow (e.g., `Auto Update Support Tier`)
    
3. Click **Activate**
    

---

## 🧪 Test the Flow

1. Open **Sales App → Accounts**
    
2. Select: `Beebs Publishing`
    
3. Confirm: Support Tier = `Bronze`
    
4. Edit the **Beebs Publishing Q1** opportunity
    
5. Set **Amount = 5,500** → Click **Save**
    
6. Go back to the account and **refresh**
    
7. ✅ Support Tier is now `Gold`
    

> The flow automatically checked the threshold via metadata and updated the account—no code required!

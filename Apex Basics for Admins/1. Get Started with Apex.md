## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this unit, you’ll be able to:

- Define what code is.
- Describe where to store and edit code.
- Describe two ways to create code comments.
- Explain the importance of code commenting.

## 🧠 What Is Code?

- Code = A language used to give instructions to computers.
- Similar to a **recipe**: each step must be precise.
- There are many programming languages: **JavaScript, Java, Ruby, Python**, etc.
- Apex is Salesforce’s proprietary programming language, built on Java-like syntax.

---

## 🛠️ Where Is Apex Code Stored?

### 🧾 Code Storage Options:
- Locally (PC/Mac)
- In the cloud (Salesforce org)
- Locally synced with the cloud

### 🧰 Developer Console:
A built-in Salesforce tool for writing, editing, and running Apex code.

#### How to Access:
1. Log in to Trailhead.
2. Click your avatar → **Hands-on Orgs** → Launch Org.
3. Go to **Setup** → Select **Developer Console**.

Keep the console open throughout the module.

## ✍️ Writing Pseudocode

- Pseudocode = Planning tool written in **plain language** to describe what code should do.
- Helps non-developers understand the logic before actual coding starts.
- Usually written before Apex development begins.

### 🔧 Pseudocode Example: Making Tea

```plaintext
Get Utensils and Ingredients
    Get Teacup
    Get Spoon
    Get Tea Kettle
    Get Teapot
    Get Tea
    Get Sugar
Boil Water in a Tea Kettle
    Fill Kettle with Water
    Switch Kettle On
    Wait for Kettle to Boil
Make Tea in Teapot
    Put Tea in Teapot
    Put Boiling Water in Teapot
    Wait 2 Minutes
Add Tea and Sugar to Teacup
    Pour Tea in Teacup
    Put 1 teaspoon of Sugar in Teacup
    Stir Tea in Teacup
Serve Tea to Friend
````

- Think like a developer:
    
    - What if the kettle is already full?
        
    - What happens if something is missing?
        
    - Always consider different scenarios.

## 🧾 Code Commenting

Used to **describe** and **explain** code.

### Why It's Important:

- Makes code easier to understand.
    
- Helps other developers (or your future self) understand what the code is doing.
    
- Essential for collaboration and debugging.
    

### 🗒️ Two Types of Comments:

#### 1. **Single Line Comment**

```java
// This is a single line comment
Integer i = 1; // Comment next to code
```

#### 2. **Multiline Comment**

```java
/*
This is a multiline comment.
It can span multiple lines.
Used to describe larger blocks.
*/
```

### 💡 Best Practice:

- Keep indentation consistent inside multiline comments for better readability.

## 💻 Example: Teatime Class with Commented Pseudocode

```java
/*
Get Utensils and Ingredients
    Get Teacup
    Get Spoon
    Get Tea Kettle
    Get Teapot
    Get Tea
    Get Sugar
Boil water in a Tea Kettle
    Fill Kettle with Water
    Switch Kettle On
    Wait for Kettle to Boil
Make Tea in Teapot
    Put Tea in Teapot
    Put Boiling Water in Teapot
    Wait 2 Minutes
Add Tea and Sugar to Teacup
    Pour Tea in Teacup
    Put 1 teaspoon of Sugar in Teacup
    Stir Tea in Teacup
Serve Tea to a Friend
*/
public class Teatime {
}
```

📁 Save the file: `File > Save`

## 📌 Summary

- **Code** = Instructions for computers.
    
- **Developer Console** = Where Apex code is created and tested.
    
- **Pseudocode** = Plain language outline of what code should do.
    
- **Comments**:
    
    - **Single-line**: `//`
        
    - **Multiline**: `/* */`
        
- **Commenting** improves clarity and collaboration.

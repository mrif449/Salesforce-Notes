## üîë **Learning Objectives**

- Understand two types of relationship queries: **child-to-parent** and **parent-to-child**.
    
- Identify how objects are related.
    
- Use **dot notation** for child-to-parent queries.
    
- Use **subqueries** for parent-to-child queries.
    
- Filter results using a **subquery in the WHERE clause**.

## üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ About Relationship Queries

- SOQL supports querying related objects through **relationship queries**.
    
- These allow you to return fields from **two related objects**, even though `FROM` can only specify one object.

## üìò Types of Relationship Queries

### 1. **Child-to-Parent**

- Used when querying the **child object** and retrieving fields from the **parent**.
    
- Syntax uses **dot notation**:  
    `SELECT Name, Account.Name FROM Contact`
    

### 2. **Parent-to-Child**

- Used when querying the **parent object** and retrieving records from related **child objects**.
    
- Uses a **subquery** with the **child relationship name** (usually plural):  
    `SELECT Name, (SELECT Name FROM Contacts) FROM Account`

## üîç How to Identify Object Relationships

- Look at the **child object‚Äôs lookup/master-detail fields** (e.g., `Contact.AccountId`).
    
- In Object Manager:
    
    - **Field Name**: Used in code (`AccountId`)
        
    - **Child Relationship Name**: Used in subqueries (`Contacts`)

## üß† Filtering with a Subquery

To filter parent records by a condition in child records:

```sql
SELECT Name, (SELECT Name FROM Contacts)
FROM Account
WHERE Id IN (SELECT AccountId FROM Contact WHERE LastName = 'Forbes')
```

This does:

1. Finds `Contact` records with `LastName = 'Forbes'`.
    
2. Retrieves their `AccountId`.
    
3. Filters `Account` records where `Id` matches those `AccountId`s.
    
4. Returns those accounts **and all their related contacts**.
    

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- **Child-to-parent:** dot notation (`Account.Name`)
    
- **Parent-to-child:** subquery (`(SELECT Name FROM Contacts)`)
    
- **Filtering:** use `WHERE Id IN (SELECT AccountId FROM ...)` on parent.

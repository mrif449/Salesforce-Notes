## ðŸ§  Key Reminders for Admin Test
- BOTanicals uses standard objects (**Order**, **OrderItem**, **Product**, **Account**) with custom fields.
- Automation is performed with **code**, not Flow (but similar logic can be done with Flows).
- Orders trigger a **bonus bouquet** when activated.
- Custom page layouts must be assigned to all profiles to apply changes.
- Always **pin list views** for easier navigation in real-world usage.
- Sample data is loaded via **Flow**, not manually entered.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Tip:
This project helps admins understand the connection between **code-based automation** (e.g., Apex triggers) and **point-and-click tools** (e.g., Process Builder or Flow).

## üéØ **Learning Objectives**

After completing this module, you should be able to:

- Understand what integration patterns are.
    
- Identify and evaluate different Salesforce integration patterns.

## üîç **What Are Integration Patterns?**

- **Integration Patterns** are proven, reusable ways to solve common integration problems.
    
- They describe **how systems (or components/services) interact**.
    
- Patterns aren‚Äôt step-by-step guides, but recommended best practice **approaches**.
    
- They help architects **avoid reinventing the wheel** by providing tested models.

## üß† **How to Use Integration Patterns**

- Start with the **sample scenario** given for each pattern.
    
- Evaluate if the **recommended technologies and approaches** match your needs.
    
- Integration patterns usually recommend **Salesforce technologies** (e.g., connectors, APIs).

## üìã **Three Main Integration Types**

|**Integration Type**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|
|**Application Integration**|Extend features & UI across systems (e.g., API triggers, flows, connectors).|
|**Data Integration**|Sync data between systems (focus on data integrity, governance, migration).|
|**Process Integration**|Run processes/services across systems (e.g., events triggering activity).|

## üîê **Security Considerations**

- Critical to any integration solution.
    
- Common concerns:
    
    - **SSO** (Single Sign-On)
        
    - **SAML**
        
    - **Data Encryption** (e.g., Shield Platform Encryption for GDPR compliance)

## üí° **Salesforce Lightning Platform Integration Patterns**

|**Pattern**|**Use Case**|
|---|---|
|**Remote Process Invocation ‚Äì Request & Reply**|Salesforce calls a remote system **and waits** for a reply.|
|**Remote Process Invocation ‚Äì Fire & Forget**|Salesforce calls a remote system **but doesn't wait** for completion.|
|**Batch Data Synchronization**|Updates are synced between systems in **batches**.|
|**Remote Call-In**|Remote system **performs CRUD** on Salesforce data.|
|**Data Virtualization**|Salesforce accesses external data **in real time**, without storing it.|
|**High-Frequency Data Replication**|High-volume, near real-time **data replication** from source to target.|
|**Publish/Subscribe**|Salesforce **publishes events**, any number of subscribers may react to them.|

---

## üìò **Important Concepts**

- Patterns are **not code**, but **strategic designs**.
    
- Each pattern solves a specific **integration challenge**.
    
- Selecting the right pattern depends on the **type of integration initiative**.

## üîó Salesforce Platform APIs
- **Custom objects/fields** end with `__c` (e.g. `Property__c`)  
- Every object has an API name‚Äîuse these to access data

| **REST API**         | Access org data with RESTful calls                                              |
| **Metadata API**     | Manage customizations and metadata model                                        |

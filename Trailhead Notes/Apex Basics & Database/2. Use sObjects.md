## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand the relationship between sObjects and Salesforce records.
- Create and use specific sObject variables.
- Cast generic sObjects to specific sObject types.

---

## 🧠 What is an sObject?
- sObject = Salesforce Object.
- Every record in Salesforce is represented as an sObject in Apex.
- Apex allows direct access to records/fields via sObjects.
- Example:
  ```apex
  Account acct = new Account(Name='Acme');


---

## 🔄 Standard vs Custom sObjects

- **Standard Objects**: `Account`, `Contact`, `Lead`, `Opportunity`, etc.
    
- **Custom Objects**: API name ends with `__c` (e.g., `Merchandise__c`).
    
- **Custom Relationship Fields**: end in `__r`.
    

---

## 🏷 API Names

- Used in Apex to reference fields and objects.
    
- Custom fields: `__c` suffix (e.g., `Description__c`).
    
- Custom relationships: `__r` suffix (e.g., `Items__r`).
    
- Spaces in labels = underscores in API names.
    

---

## 🔍 How to Find API Names

- Go to **Setup > Object Manager**.
    
- Click on the object name to view fields and their API names.

## 🛠 Creating sObjects

```apex
// Empty object
Account acct = new Account();

// Using constructor to assign fields
Account acct = new Account(Name='Acme', Phone='(415)555-1212', NumberOfEmployees=100);

// Using dot notation
Account acct = new Account();
acct.Name = 'Acme';
acct.Phone = '(415)555-1212';
acct.NumberOfEmployees = 100;
```

## 🧰 Generic vs Specific sObject

### ✅ Specific sObject

- Typed, can only reference one object type.
    
- Allows **dot notation**.
    

```apex
Account acct = new Account(Name='Acme');
```

### 🌀 Generic sObject

- Can reference **any** object (standard/custom).
    
- Use `get()` and `put()` for field access.
    

```apex
sObject sobj1 = new Account(Name='Trailhead');
sObject sobj2 = new Book__c(Name='Workbook 1');
```

---

## 🔄 Casting sObjects

- Cast generic to specific to access fields directly.
    

```apex
Account acct = (Account)myGenericSObject;
String name = acct.Name;
```

---

## 🚨 Reminder

> Creating an sObject does **not** save it to the database.  
> To save/retrieve data:

- Use **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** for saving records.
    
- Use **SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language)** to retrieve records.
    

---

## ✅ Summary Checklist

-  Know standard/custom object naming conventions.
    
-  Be comfortable creating and populating sObjects.
    
-  Understand dot notation vs get/put.
    
-  Know how to cast generic to specific sObjects.
    
-  Understand difference between in-memory sObject vs persisted record.

Here are your study notes for the **"Write SOQL Queries"** Trailhead module, formatted in Markdown for easy review:

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Write SOQL queries in Apex.
- Execute SOQL queries using the Developer Console Query Editor.
- Execute inline SOQL in Anonymous Apex.
- Query related records using relationship queries.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started with SOQL

- **SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language)** is used to read records.
- Similar to SQL, but tailored for Salesforce‚Äôs Lightning Platform.
- SOQL queries can be written directly in Apex, called **inline SOQL**.
  
```apex
  Account[] accts = [SELECT Name, Phone FROM Account];
```

---

## üß™ Sample Data (Use in Execute Anonymous Window)

```apex
Account acct = new Account(Name='SFDC Computing', Phone='(415)555-1212',
    NumberOfEmployees=50, BillingCity='San Francisco');
insert acct;

ID acctID = acct.ID;

Contact con = new Contact(FirstName='Carol', LastName='Ruiz',
    Phone='(415)555-1212', Department='Wingo', AccountId=acctID);
insert con;

Account acct2 = new Account(Name='The SFDC Query Man',
    Phone='(310)555-1213', NumberOfEmployees=50, BillingCity='Los Angeles',
    Description='Expert in wing technologies.');
insert acct2;
```

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Use the Query Editor

- Found in **Developer Console ‚Üí Query Editor** tab.
    
- No Apex code needed, just plain SOQL.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT Name, Phone FROM Account
    ```
    

---

## üõ† Basic SOQL Syntax

```sql
SELECT fields FROM ObjectName [WHERE condition]
```

- Example:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT Name, Phone FROM Account
    ```
    
- Notes:
    
    - No `*` wildcard: must list each field.
        
    - `Id` is always returned in Apex even if not listed.
        

---

## üéØ Filtering Query Results

```sql
SELECT Name, Phone FROM Account WHERE Name = 'SFDC Computing'
```

- Combine conditions using:
    
    - `AND`, `OR`
        
    - Parentheses for complex logic:
        
        ```sql
        SELECT Name, Phone FROM Account
        WHERE (Name='SFDC Computing' AND NumberOfEmployees>25)
        ```
        
- Fuzzy matching with `LIKE`:
    
    ```sql
    WHERE Name LIKE 'SFDC%'
    ```
    

---

## üìë Ordering Results

```sql
SELECT Name, Phone FROM Account ORDER BY Name ASC
SELECT Name, Phone FROM Account ORDER BY Name DESC
```

- Can sort by numeric and text fields.
    
- Can't sort by rich text or multi-select picklists.
    

---

## üî¢ Limiting Records

```apex
Account oneAccountOnly = [SELECT Name, Phone FROM Account LIMIT 1];
```

- Useful when you want just a sample or one record.
    

---

## üîÑ Combine Clauses

```apex
Account[] accts = [SELECT Name, Phone FROM Account
                   WHERE (Name='SFDC Computing' AND NumberOfEmployees>25)
                   ORDER BY Name
                   LIMIT 10];
System.debug(accts);
```

---

## üéØ Using Variables in Queries (Binding)

```apex
String targetDepartment = 'Wingo';
Contact[] techContacts = [SELECT FirstName, LastName
                          FROM Contact WHERE Department = :targetDepartment];
```

- Use `:` to bind Apex variables in SOQL.
    

---

## üîó Querying Related Records

### üîÑ Parent to Child (Subquery)

```sql
SELECT Name, (SELECT LastName FROM Contacts)
FROM Account
WHERE Name = 'SFDC Computing'
```

### üîÑ In Apex:

```apex
Account[] acctsWithContacts = [SELECT Name, (SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Contacts)
                               FROM Account
                               WHERE Name = 'SFDC Computing'];
Contact[] cts = acctsWithContacts[0].Contacts;
```

### üîÑ Child to Parent (Dot Notation)

```apex
Contact[] cts = [SELECT Account.Name FROM Contact
                 WHERE FirstName = 'Carol' AND LastName = 'Ruiz'];
String acctName = cts[0].Account.Name;
```

- For **custom relationships**, use `__r` suffix:
    
    - e.g., `Invoice_Statement__c` ‚Üí `Line_Items__r`
        

---

## üîÅ Query Records in Batches (SOQL For Loops)

### üîπ Syntax:

```apex
for (sObject : [SELECT ...]) {
    // single record processing
}

for (sObjectList : [SELECT ...]) {
    // batch processing (recommended)
}
```

### üîπ Example:

```apex
insert new Account[]{
  new Account(Name = 'for loop 1'),
  new Account(Name = 'for loop 2'),
  new Account(Name = 'for loop 3')
};

Integer i = 0, j = 0;
for (Account[] tmp : [SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Name LIKE 'for loop _']) {
    j = tmp.size();
    i++;
}
System.assertEquals(3, j);
System.assertEquals(1, i);
```

- Efficient chunking avoids heap size issues.
    
- Recommended for large datasets to avoid governor limits.

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- Always specify fields‚Äîno `SELECT *`.
    
- Use `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT` to control and refine query results.
    
- Leverage relationships with subqueries (`__r` for custom).
    
- Use SOQL for loops for performance and limits.

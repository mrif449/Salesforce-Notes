## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand why and when to restrict field access.
    
- Set field-level permissions using permission sets.
    
- Update field permissions across multiple permission sets efficiently.

## 🔐 Why Limit Field Access?

Sometimes users need access to an object, but **not every field** within it. Field permissions (field-level security) help protect **sensitive data**, like:

- Social Security Numbers (SSN)
    
- Compensation details
    
- Read-only fields that shouldn’t be edited
    

> Field permissions apply **everywhere**—reports, list views, search, related lists—not just page layouts.

## 🧱 Example Field Restrictions (Recruiting App)

|Object|Field|Hidden From|
|---|---|---|
|Position|Min/Max Bonus|Standard Employees, Interviewers|
|Candidate|SSN|Hiring Managers, Interviewers|
|Job Application|Position/Candidate (Lookup)|Read-Only for Hiring Managers|

## 🛠 How to Set Field Permissions (Using Permission Sets)

1. Go to **Setup > Permission Sets**.
    
2. Click **New**.
    
3. Label: `Update Candidate Records`
    
4. License: `–None–`
    
5. Click **Save**.
    
6. Under **Find Settings**, search for `Candidates`.
    
7. Click **Edit**.
    
8. Under **Object Permissions**: enable **Read**.
    
9. Under **Field Permissions**:
    
    - ✅ Read & Edit: `Apex`, `C#`
        
    - ✅ Read only: `Hire By`, `Hiring Manager`
        
    - 🚫 No access: `SSN`, `Email`, `Phone`
        
10. Click **Save**.
    

> You can then **assign this permission set** directly or include it in a **permission set group**.

## ⚡ Bulk Update Field Permissions

To avoid manually editing multiple permission sets:

1. From **Setup**, search **User Management Settings**.
    
2. Enable ✅ **Field-Level Security for Permission Sets during Field Creation**.
    
3. Go to **Object Manager > Candidate > Fields & Relationships**.
    
4. Select a field (e.g., `Job Category`).
    
5. Click **Set Field-Level Security**.
    
6. Update access for multiple permission sets at once.
    

> Filter by “Permission sets with object permissions” to focus only on relevant sets.

## ✅ Summary

- Use **field permissions** to control access to sensitive info.
    
- Always manage field access using **permission sets and groups**, not just page layouts.
    
- Use **bulk tools** to save time when updating multiple permission sets.
    
- Combine **object**, **field**, and **record**-level security for a complete access model.

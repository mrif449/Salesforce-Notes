## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

- ✅ View and modify the role hierarchy
    
- ✅ Create and assign roles to simplify access to records

## 🔐 Role Hierarchy & Record Access

- **Role hierarchy** works with **organization-wide defaults (OWD)** to control data access.
    
- Users can access records **owned by or shared with** users **below them** in the hierarchy.
    
- Unlike an org chart, a **role hierarchy is based on data access needs**, not job titles.
    

### Key Points

- Users **higher in the hierarchy** can view, edit, and report on data from users below.
    
- **Exception:** For **custom objects**, you can **disable role-based access** via **Grant Access Using Hierarchies** (in OWD).
    
- Start with your org chart, then **group similar roles** based on data access, not titles.
    

📌 _Example_: Staff Software Engineer & Junior Software Engineer → Single "Software Engineer" role.

## 🧱 Example Role Hierarchy – Recruiting App

- Hiring managers can view but **can’t create or update** position-related records unless owned/shared.
    
- You’ll configure **HR roles** to provide proper access.
    

### Sample Hierarchy

```
CEO (Cynthia)
├── VP of Development (Andrew)
│   ├── Dev Manager (Ben)
│   │   ├── Engineers: Melissa, Tom, Craig
│   └── QA Director (Clark)
│       ├── QA Engineers: Flash, Harry
└── VP of Human Resources (Megan)
    ├── Recruiting Manager (Phil)
    │   ├── Recruiter: Mario
    └── Onboarding Manager
```

### Access Control

- **CEO** sees/updates everything.
    
- **VPs** access data from their managers & teams.
    
- **Managers** can access data owned by their direct reports.

## ⚙️ How to Define a Role in Salesforce

### 🛠 Create a Role (e.g., Onboarding Manager)

1. Go to **Setup** → Search for **Roles**.
    
2. If prompted, click **Set Up Roles** to skip the splash page.
    
3. Use **Tree View** (default) to visualize the hierarchy.
    
4. Click **Expand All** to view existing roles.
    
5. Under **VP Human Resources**, click **Add Role**.
    
6. Fill in:
    
    - **Label**: Onboarding Manager
        
    - **Role Name**: auto-filled
        
    - **Reports To**: VP Human Resources
        
    - _(Optional)_ Report Display Name (short version)
        
7. Leave other settings (e.g., Contact/Opportunity Access) as default.
    
8. Click **Save**.
    

### 👤 Assign Users to Role

1. Click **Onboarding Manager** → **Assign Users to Role**.
    
2. From the dropdown, select **All Unassigned**.
    
3. Add a user to the role → Click **Save**.
    

💡 Tip: When adding a new role, use **Add Role** under the relevant parent role to auto-fill the “Reports To” field.

## ✅ Final Thoughts

- Role hierarchy is a **powerful tool** for data access.
    
- With **org-wide defaults + role hierarchy**, your Recruiting app is almost complete.
    
- Use **sharing rules** to share records **across separate hierarchy branches**.

## 📘 What Are Sharing Rules?

- **Purpose**: Provide **automatic exceptions** to org-wide defaults (OWDs)
    
- Only apply if **OWD is Private or Public Read Only**
    
- **Never restrict access**—they only **extend** it
    

### 🔑 Components of a Sharing Rule:

1. **Which Records?**
    
    - Based on ownership
        
    - Or based on record field values (criteria-based)
        
2. **Who Gets Access?**
    
    - Users defined by:
        
        - Role
            
        - Role & subordinates
            
        - Territory
            
        - Public Group (combination of users, roles, groups, etc.)
            
3. **What Access Level?**
    
    - **Read Only**
        
    - **Read/Write**

- Use **public groups** for flexibility and ease of maintenance
    
- Avoid using sharing rules for **dynamic** or **unpredictable** access needs
    
- For ad-hoc access, use **manual sharing**

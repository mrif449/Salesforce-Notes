## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you can:

- List the **4 ways to control record access**
    
- Identify when to use each method
    
- Understand how record-level security features **work together**
    
- Configure **Org-Wide Defaults (OWD)** for record access

## 🧩 What Is Record-Level Security?

Field permissions limit **which fields** users see or edit.  
**Record-level security** controls **which records** users can access in an object.

Before deciding how to manage access, ask:

- Should all users see all records?
    
- If not, **who** should see **which** records?
    
- What are the **rules** for access?

## 🛠 Four Ways to Control Record Access (Increasing Access)

|Method|What It Does|Use Case|
|---|---|---|
|**1. Org-Wide Defaults (OWD)**|Set baseline access to records a user **doesn’t own**|Start with least access|
|**2. Role Hierarchies**|Grant **managers** access to subordinates’ records|Standard management access|
|**3. Sharing Rules**|Automatically grant access to **groups** or roles|Collaboration among peers|
|**4. Manual Sharing**|Record owner shares specific records manually|Case-by-case exceptions|

---

## 🧠 Key Principles

- **Profiles & Permission Sets** define baseline object access.
    
- **Org-wide defaults** define access to records a user **doesn’t own**.
    
- Role hierarchies & sharing rules can **open access**, not restrict it.
    
- **Manual sharing** is for special exceptions.
    

> 🔒 Start restrictive with OWD, then open up as needed.

## 🗂 Org-Wide Defaults (OWD)

OWD define the **minimum access** users have to object records they don’t own.

Set **internal** and **external** access for each object using these options:

|Sharing Setting|Access|
|---|---|
|**Private**|Only owner + role hierarchy can access|
|**Public Read Only**|All users can view, but not edit|
|**Public Read/Write**|All users can view and edit|
|**Controlled by Parent**|Inherits access from parent object|

> Object permissions still limit **what actions** users can take.

## 🧪 Example: Recruiting App (Position Object)

**Q1:** Who is the most restricted user?  
👉 A standard employee (can view positions)

**Q2:** Should they see every record?  
✅ Yes

**Q3:** Should they edit every record?  
❌ No

👉 **Set OWD to Public Read Only** for Position  
👉 Set **Private** for Candidate, Job Application, and Review

> Note: **Review** inherits settings from its parent object due to master-detail relationship.

---

## ⚙️ Set OWD in Salesforce

1. Go to **Setup > Sharing Settings**
    
2. Click **Edit** in Organization-Wide Defaults
    
3. For each object, set:
    
    - **Internal Access**
        
    - **External Access**
        
4. Optionally, uncheck **Grant Access Using Hierarchies** (custom objects only)
    
5. Click **Save**
    

> Recalculation runs automatically. You’ll get an email once complete.

## ✅ Summary

- Use **org-wide defaults** to lock down access.
    
- Use **role hierarchies**, **sharing rules**, and **manual sharing** to selectively open access.
    
- These controls **work together** to form your record-level security model.

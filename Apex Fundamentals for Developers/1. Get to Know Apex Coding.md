## üß† What Are Coding Languages?

- **Purpose**: Translate human logic into computer-executable actions.
    
- **Benefits**:
    
    - Shareable and understandable logic among programmers.
        
    - More readable and intuitive than binary code.
        
    - Essential for building modern applications and business operations.

## üß© What Is Apex?

- **Definition**: A proprietary programming language by Salesforce.
    
- **Access**: Through the **Developer Console** in Salesforce.
    
- **Inspired by**: Java (syntax and structure).
    
- **Power**: Works natively with the **Salesforce API** for deeper platform customization.

## üìù When to Use Apex vs. No-Code Tools

|Use No-Code Tools (e.g., Flow)|Use Apex|
|---|---|
|Simple automation|Complex logic across multiple objects|
|Quick changes|Custom APIs or integrations|
|Repetitive business logic|Conditional logic based on record state or relationships|

‚úÖ Apex is powerful but should be used when no-code options aren‚Äôt sufficient. Know your tools!

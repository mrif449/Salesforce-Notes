 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Make SOQL queries dynamic using **bind variables**.
- Use **aggregate functions** to summarize data.
- Use **GROUP BY** to group query results.
- Know when to use **WHERE** vs. **HAVING**.

## 🔗 Bind Variables in SOQL

### ✅ What are Bind Variables?
Bind variables allow you to **insert Apex variables into a SOQL query** to make it dynamic.

### 🧾 Static Query Example:
```apex
List<Property__c> property = [
  SELECT Id, Name, Price__c 
  FROM Property__c 
  WHERE Price__c < 200000
];
````

### 🧾 Dynamic Query using Bind Variable:

```apex
Integer maxHomeValue = 200000;
List<Property__c> property = [
  SELECT Name, Price__c 
  FROM Property__c 
  WHERE Price__c < :maxHomeValue
];
```

➡️ Use `:` before the variable name in SOQL.

### 🔍 Real-world Use:

- DreamHouse app uses a **Max Price slider** tied to a bind variable.
    
- As the slider changes, the query updates results dynamically.

## 🔢 Aggregate Functions in SOQL

Use aggregate functions to **summarize data** from records.

|Function|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`COUNT()`|Count all rows|`SELECT COUNT(Name) FROM Broker__c`|
|`COUNT_DISTINCT()`|Count unique values|`SELECT COUNT_DISTINCT(City__c) FROM Property__c`|
|`MIN()`|Minimum value (works with dates too)|`SELECT MIN(Days_On_Market__c) FROM Property__c`|
|`MAX()`|Maximum value (works with picklists too)|`SELECT MAX(Beds__c) FROM Property__c`|
|`AVG()`|Average of numeric field|`SELECT City__c, AVG(Days_On_Market__c) FROM Property__c GROUP BY City__c`|
|`SUM()`|Total sum of a numeric field|`SELECT SUM(Price__c), Broker__r.Name FROM Property__c GROUP BY Broker__r.Name`|

---

## 📊 GROUP BY Clause

Use `GROUP BY` to **group results** (like a summary report).

### 🧾 Example:

```apex
SELECT MAX(Status__c), Broker__r.Name
FROM Property__c
GROUP BY Broker__r.Name
```

- This shows the **latest Status__c** for each broker.

## 🔍 HAVING vs WHERE

|Clause|Use When…|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`WHERE`|Filtering **before** aggregation|`WHERE City__c = 'Boston'`|
|`HAVING`|Filtering **after** aggregation|`HAVING MAX(Status__c) = 'Closed'`|

### 🧾 Example Using HAVING:

```apex
SELECT MAX(Status__c), Broker__r.Name
FROM Property__c
GROUP BY Broker__r.Name
HAVING MAX(Status__c) = 'Closed'
```

---

## ✅ Quick Practice Summary

### 1. Count all properties:

```apex
SELECT COUNT(City__c) FROM Property__c
```

### 2. Count unique cities:

```apex
SELECT COUNT_DISTINCT(City__c) FROM Property__c
```

### 3. Find earliest listed date:

```apex
SELECT MIN(Date_Listed__c) FROM Property__c
```

### 4. Sum price grouped by broker:

```apex
SELECT SUM(Price__c), Broker__r.Name 
FROM Property__c 
GROUP BY Broker__r.Name
```

### 5. Brokers with Closed status properties:

```apex
SELECT MAX(Status__c), Broker__r.Name 
FROM Property__c 
GROUP BY Broker__r.Name 
HAVING MAX(Status__c) = 'Closed'
```

## 📝 Final Tips

- Use `:` for bind variables.
    
- `COUNT()` includes duplicates; `COUNT_DISTINCT()` doesn’t.
    
- `HAVING` comes **after GROUP BY**, and is used for **filtered aggregates**.
    
- `MIN()` and `MAX()` work with **numbers, dates, and picklists**.
    
- Use `GROUP BY` for reports that require **grouped summaries**.

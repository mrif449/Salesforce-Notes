## ‚úÖ **Learning Objectives Recap**

By the end of this unit, you should be able to:

- Read object relationship diagrams in Schema Builder.
    
- Identify custom relationship names for use in SOQL.
    
- Write **child-to-parent** SOQL queries.
    
- Write **parent-to-child** SOQL subqueries.

## üîß **Set Up: DreamHouse App**

- Install the DreamHouse package in your Trailhead Playground using package ID: `04t3h000004mBpiAAE`.
    
- Use the **DreamHouse app** to explore custom objects like `Broker__c` and `Property__c`.
    

---

## üìä **Schema Exploration Tips**

- Use **Schema Builder** to visualize relationships.
    
- Turn on **Display Element Names** to see API names (`Broker__c`, `Property__c`).
    
- The `Property__c` object has a lookup to `Broker__c` via the `Broker__c` field.
    
- The **Child Relationship Name** from Broker to Property is `Properties`.

## üîç **SOQL Queries**

### 1. **Basic Query (No Relationship Traversal)**

```sql
SELECT Address__c, Picture__c, Broker__c FROM Property__c
```

- Returns raw IDs for the broker (not helpful for users).
    

### 2. **Child-to-Parent Query (Custom Relationship Field)**

```sql
SELECT Address__c, Picture__c, Broker__r.Name FROM Property__c
```

- Use `Broker__r` to **traverse** to the `Broker__c` object and fetch the `Name` field.
    
- Remember: For custom objects, replace `__c` with `__r` when traversing relationships.
    

### 3. **Parent-to-Child Query (Subquery)**

```sql
SELECT Name, (SELECT Address__c, Price__c FROM Properties__r) FROM Broker__c
```

- `Broker__c` is the parent, so the child `Property__c` objects are accessed via subquery.
    
- Use `Properties__r`, the **child relationship name**, for the subquery.

## üß† **Important SOQL Reminders**

- Use `__r` instead of `__c` when querying related objects (custom only).
    
- In **child-to-parent**, dot-notation (e.g., `Broker__r.Name`).
    
- In **parent-to-child**, subquery using the **child relationship name** (e.g., `Properties__r`).

## Learning Objectives

After completing this unit, you will be able to:
- **Describe the perks of using objects** on the Salesforce CRM platform.
- **Explain the difference** between standard objects and custom objects.
- **List the types of custom fields** an object can have.

---

## 1. Overview of Objects

- **What are Objects?**  
  - In Salesforce, data is organized into **objects**, which are similar to database tables.
  - **Rows/Records:** Each row in a table is called a **record**.
  - **Columns/Fields:** Each column in a table is called a **field**.
- **Real-World Analogy:**  
  - Think of storing data in a spreadsheet:
    - **Spreadsheet:** Represents an object.
    - **Columns:** Represent fields (e.g., Address, Price, etc.).
    - **Rows:** Represent individual records (e.g., one property listing).

- **Data Model:**  
  - The collection of objects and fields in your Salesforce app makes up your **data model**.
  - Objects give structure, enforce data consistency, and include built-in functionality like page layouts and record management.

## 2. Standard vs. Custom Objects

### Standard Objects
- **Definition:**  
  - Prebuilt objects that come with Salesforce.
- **Examples:**  
  - **Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity**
- **Use Case:**  
  - Manage general customer data, like tracking potential buyers and managing sales pipelines.

### Custom Objects
- **Definition:**  
  - Objects created to store information unique to your company or industry.
- **Example:**  
  - **Property Object for DreamHouse:**  
    - Tracks unique details about properties for sale (e.g., address, price, number of bedrooms).
- **Key Benefit:**  
  - Tailor your data model to match specific business requirements while benefiting from Salesforce's built-in features (e.g., page layouts, automatic tab creation).

## 3. Types of Custom Fields on an Object

Every standard and custom object comes with several built-in fields (such as Identity, System, and Name). You can extend an object by adding custom fields. Here are the main types:

### Standard Field Types
- **Identity Fields:**  
  - Automatically generated, 15-character, case-sensitive fields.  
  - **Example:** Account ID (e.g., `0015000000Gv7qJ`).
- **System Fields:**  
  - Read-only fields that capture system information (e.g., record creation date).  
  - **Examples:** `CreatedDate`, `LastModifiedDate`.
- **Name Fields:**  
  - Essential fields for record identification.  
  - Can be text or auto-numbered (e.g., contact name like "Julie Bean" or case name like "CA-1024").

### Custom Field Types
- **Custom Fields:**  
  - Fields you create on standard or custom objects.  
  - **Example:** Adding a **Birthday** field on the Contact object.
  
- **Data Type Examples:**  
  - **Checkbox:** For "yes" or "no" values.
  - **Date or DateTime:** For capturing dates and time-specific events (e.g., birthdays, sales milestones).
  - **Currency:** Suitable for tracking monetary values (e.g., property price).
  - **Formula:** Automatically calculates values using a specified formula (e.g., calculating commission).
  - **Text, Number, Picklist, etc.:** Other common types to match the specific data you need to store.

## 4. Hands-On: Creating a Custom Object and Adding Fields

### Creating a Custom Object (Example: Property)
1. **Launch a Trailhead Playground:**  
   - Create or access a fresh Trailhead Playground.
2. **Access Setup:**  
   - Click the gear icon and select **Setup**.
3. **Go to Object Manager:**  
   - From Setup, click on the **Object Manager** tab.
4. **Create a Custom Object:**  
   - Click **Create | Custom Object**.
   - **Fill in Details:**
     - **Label:** Property  
     - **Object Name:** Auto-populated (e.g., Property)
     - **Plural Label:** Properties
   - **Special Step:**  
     - Check the box **Launch New Custom Tab Wizard after saving**.
   - Click **Save**.
5. **Customize Tab Style:**  
   - On the New Custom Object Tab page, select your preferred **Tab Style**, then click through **Next** and **Save**.

### Creating a Custom Field (Example: Price Field)
1. **Navigate to Property Object:**  
   - In Setup, go to **Object Manager** and select **Property**.
2. **Add a New Field:**  
   - Click **Fields & Relationships** and then click **New**.
3. **Select Field Type:**  
   - Choose **Currency** as the field type.
4. **Configure the Field:**  
   - **Field Label:** Price  
   - **Description:** The listed sale price of the home.
   - Check the **Required** box.
   - Proceed with the default settings by clicking **Next**, review your settings with **Next** again, and click **Save**.
5. **Field Naming:**  
   - Notice that in the field list, the custom field appears as `Price__c`—the `__c` indicates a custom field.

### Creating a Record (Example: Adding a Property Record)
1. **Open the App Launcher:**  
   - Find and select the **Sales** app (or the app where your Property tab exists).
2. **Navigate to Properties Tab:**  
   - Click the **Properties** tab. If not immediately visible, check under the **More** dropdown.
3. **Create a New Record:**  
   - Click **New**.
   - Enter the required details (e.g., Property name, Price) and click **Save**.
4. **Review the Created Record:**  
   - Verify that your new property record displays the data you entered.

## 5. Best Practices for Customization

- **Thoughtful Naming:**  
  - Use clear, descriptive names for objects and fields. Avoid generic labels like "Property2" when a more descriptive name is needed.
- **Descriptions and Help Text:**  
  - Add detailed descriptions or help text to assist users in understanding the purpose of each object or field.
- **Required Fields:**  
  - Make critical fields required (e.g., property price) to ensure complete and consistent data entry.

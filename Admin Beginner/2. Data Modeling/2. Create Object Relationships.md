## 1. Object Relationships

### Overview
- **Definition:** Special field type that connects two objects together.
- **Purpose:** Allows data from different objects to be linked (e.g., linking an Account to its Contacts).
- **Use Cases:** Standard relationships (e.g., Account-Contact) and custom relationships (e.g., Property-Offer).

### Types of Object Relationships
- **Lookup Relationship:**
  - **Characteristics:**
    - Links two objects so that one can "look up" the related record.
    - Can be one-to-one or one-to-many.
    - Objects generally remain independent with their own tabs.
  - **Example:** Account to Contact (one account can have many contacts).

- **Master-Detail Relationship:**
  - **Characteristics:**
    - A tight relationship where the master controls behaviors of the detail.
    - The detail object is dependent on the master.
    - Deleting the master record also deletes related detail records.
    - Relationship field is always created on the detail object.
  - **Example:** Property and Offer (deleting a Property deletes its related Offers).

- **Hierarchical Relationship:**
  - **Note:** A special type of lookup relationship available only on the User object (used for management chains).

### Best Practices
- **Data Model Complexity:** Adding relationships increases the complexity; be cautious when changing or deleting objects, records, or fields.
- **Screen Reader Accessibility:** Additional instructions are provided for screen reader users on Trailhead.

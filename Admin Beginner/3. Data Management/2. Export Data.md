## üöÄ Introduction to Data Export

Salesforce makes it easy to **export your data** for backup or use in other systems. Exported files are in **CSV** format and packaged into **.zip archives**.

There are **two main export methods**:

### 1. Data Export Service
- **In-browser tool** accessible via Setup.
- Supports **manual or scheduled** exports.
- Exports **all selected object data** as CSV.
- Available as:
  - **Weekly export** (Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited Editions).
  - **Monthly export** (Professional, Developer Editions).

### 2. Data Loader
- **Client application** (download required).
- Supports **UI and command-line** interface.
- Ideal for **automated** or **custom-scripted** exports.
- Can integrate with external systems via APIs.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use the Data Export Service

### Step-by-Step:

1. Go to **Setup** ‚Üí Search for **Data Export**.
2. Choose:
   - **Export Now** (manual, immediate ‚Äî available once every 7 or 29 days).
   - **Schedule Export** (automated recurring exports).
3. Select:
   - **Encoding type** (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1).
   - Options like:
     - Include **images, documents, attachments**.
     - Replace **carriage returns with spaces** (useful for import).
4. If scheduling:
   - Set **frequency** (weekly/monthly).
   - Set **start/end dates** and **time of day**.
5. Under **Exported Data**:
   - Choose specific objects or click **Include all data**.
6. Click **Start Export** or **Save** (for schedules).
7. Salesforce emails you when the **.zip archive** is ready.
   - Files are available for **48 hours**.

## üß† Notes & Tips

- Large exports are broken into **multiple CSV files** in one .zip.
- If enough time hasn‚Äôt passed since the last export, **Export Now** will be disabled.
- Use **Replace carriage returns with spaces** to avoid import issues with line breaks.
- For **automation or high-frequency needs**, use **Data Loader + scripting/API**.
- Exports are **not real-time** ‚Äî they are queued and completed ASAP.

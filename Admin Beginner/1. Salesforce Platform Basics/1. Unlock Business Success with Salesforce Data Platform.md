## 5. Customizing the Salesforce Platform: No-code vs. Programmatic

### No-code (Declarative) Development:
- **What It Is:**  
  - Customization and application building using point-and-click tools, forms, and drag-and-drop interfaces.
- **Advantages:**
  - Fast, requires minimal technical knowledge, ideal for business administrators.
  - Customizations are automatically integrated into the user interface, reports, dashboards, and mobile app.
- **Example Task: Adding a Custom Field (Prequalified?) to the Contact Object:**
  1. Click **Setup** > **Object Manager** > **Contact**.
  2. In the Contact details, click **Fields & Relationships**, then click **New**.
  3. Choose the **Checkbox** data type and click **Next**.
  4. Set the **Field Label** to `Prequalified?` (the Field Name will auto-populate).
  5. Click **Next** to accept defaults for field-level security.
  6. Ensure the field is added to all Contact Page Layouts and then click **Save**.
  7. View changes by navigating to the **Dreamhouse App** > **Contacts** tab.

### Programmatic Development:
- **What It Is:**  
  - Writing code (such as Lightning components) to create custom functionalities.
- **Use Cases:**
  - When the point-and-click tools do not meet the unique business requirements.
  - Extending platform capabilities beyond what declarative customization can handle.

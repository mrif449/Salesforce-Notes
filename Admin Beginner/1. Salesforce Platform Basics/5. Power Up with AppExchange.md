## 3. Install Your First App

### Installation Process

1. **Find an App on AppExchange:**
   - Browse or search for the app you need. For example, an app that integrates SMS messaging with Marketing Cloud Engagement.

2. **Click "Get It Now":**
   - This initiates the installation wizard which will guide you through the process.

3. **Choose Your Installation Environment:**
   - **Sandbox/Developer Edition:**  
     - Always start by installing in a nonproduction environment to test for conflicts (recommended best practice).
   - **Production:**  
     - Once testing is complete and you’re satisfied with the app’s performance, deploy it to production.

4. **Set App Permissions:**
   - Decide if the app should be available to:
     - **Admins only,**
     - **All users,** or 
     - **Specific profiles.**
   - Pre-configure user profiles if you want restricted access.

  3. Select **View Components** to inspect details such as custom fields, objects, or Apex classes included in the package.

- **Benefits of Reviewing Package Details:**
  - Helps identify any potential conflicts with your existing customizations.
  - Provides insight into the app's structure and components, allowing for further customization if needed.

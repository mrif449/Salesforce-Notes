    - Show Me: **All Accounts**.

### ➕ **Use Filter Logic (Example: High Value OR High Probability)**

1. Create a new **Opportunities** report.
    
2. Set **Close Date** to **All Time**.
    
3. Add two field filters:
    
    - **Amount > 100000**
        
    - **Probability (%) > 50**
        
4. Click More Actions > **Add Filter Logic**.
    
5. Change default **1 AND 2** to **1 OR 2**, then click **Apply**.
    

**Filter logic supports:**

- `AND` – must match all.
    
- `OR` – must match any.
    
- `NOT` – exclude results.
    
- Grouping with parentheses: `(1 OR 2) AND NOT 3`

### 🔒 **Lock Filters (Example: Partner Opportunities Only)**

1. In your report, set a field filter:
    
    - **Lead Source contains Partner**
        
2. Check the **Locked** box when applying the filter.
    
3. On the report run page, users **see but cannot change** the locked filter.

# Empower Your Users with Quick Actions

## 🔧 **Quick Actions in Salesforce**

### 🎯 **Learning Objectives**
- Understand how actions improve user workflows.
- Distinguish between **object-specific** and **global** actions.
- Learn how to **create** and **add** actions to layouts.

---

### ⚡ **What Are Quick Actions?**
- Let users **quickly perform tasks** (e.g., create records, log calls, send emails).
- Help streamline **navigation** and improve **user productivity**.
- Referred to as **“quick actions”** because they’re either **object-specific** or **global**.

---

## 📌 **Two Types of Quick Actions**

### 🧩 **1. Object-Specific Actions**
- Tied to a specific object record (e.g., Accounts, Cases).
- Show up on that object’s **page layout**.
- Automatically relate the new record to the **context record** (e.g., Contact → Account).

#### Types:
- **Create**: Make related records (e.g., New Contact on an Account).
- **Update a Record**: Modify fields of the current record.
- **Log a Call**: Add notes for interactions.
- **Custom**: Use Flows, Lightning Components, or Visualforce.
- **Send Email**: Case-specific only.

---

### 🌐 **2. Global Actions**
- Created in **Setup → Global Actions**.
- Available **anywhere in Salesforce** (not tied to a specific object).
- Use the **Global Publisher Layout** to place them in the **global actions menu** (top of screen).

#### Good for:
- Logging calls
- Creating records like Campaigns
- Sending emails from anywhere

## 🛠️ **Creating an Object-Specific Action**
Example: Create a **New Energy Audit** action on **Account** records.
1. Go to **Object Manager → Account → Buttons, Links, and Actions → New Action**.
2. Choose **Create a Record**.
3. Target Object: **Energy Audit**.
4. Label: `New Energy Audit`.
5. Save → Customize layout (remove optional fields, keep required).
6. Add action to **Account Layout → Salesforce Mobile and Lightning Experience Actions**.
7. Optionally remove unwanted actions for clarity.

---

## 🌐 **Creating a Global Action**
Example: Add a **New Campaign** action to the global menu.
1. Go to **Setup → Global Actions → New Action**.
2. Action Type: **Create a Record**, Object: **Campaign**.
3. Label: `New Campaign`, Save.
4. Customize action layout (e.g., remove `Parent Campaign`, add `Expected Revenue`).
5. Go to **Publisher Layouts → Edit Global Layout**.
6. Drag `New Campaign` to **Salesforce Mobile and Lightning Experience Actions**.
7. Save → Refresh → Confirm in the **global actions menu**.

---

## 🧠 **Pro Tips**
- If actions don’t appear in Lightning: Check if **"Salesforce Mobile and Lightning Experience Actions"** section is overridden and properly configured.
- Clean up unnecessary actions to streamline the UI.
- Use global actions for **quick access anywhere**; object-specific for **contextual relevance**.

## 3. Push Method vs. Pull Method

Understanding when to push information to users versus when to let users pull information is crucial.

- **Push Method:**
  - **Description:** Delivers guidance directly, often when users might otherwise miss critical information.
  - **Examples:**
    - **Welcome Mat:** Displayed on first login.
    - **Prompts/Popovers:** Automatically show relevant guidance on a page.
    - **Empty State & Field-Level Help:** Provide cues without any user action.

- **Pull Method:**
  - **Description:** Allows users to seek help or more details at their discretion.
  - **Examples:**
    - **Infobubble:** Reveals detailed information when a user hovers over an icon.

An effective user engagement strategy uses both methods to ensure that users receive timely information while having the ability to explore further as needed.

## 4. Additional User Engagement Options

Besides the core components, Salesforce offers several supplementary features to enhance user engagement:

- **Utility Bar Notes:**  
  - Quick access to common productivity tools via docked panels.
  
- **Rich Text Component:**  
  - Add formatted text and simple HTML content to your Lightning pages.
  
- **Guidance for Success on Path:**  
  - Step-specific tips, links, and additional instructions at each process step.
  
- **Custom Notification from a Flow:**  
  - Sends tailored notifications based on significant events (e.g., new support case alerts).
  
- **Einstein Analytics In-Dashboard Videos:**  
  - Provide educational videos directly within dashboards to drive adoption and engagement.

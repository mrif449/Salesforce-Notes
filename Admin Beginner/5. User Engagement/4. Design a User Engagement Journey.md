## 🗺️ MAP: Message, Audience, and Purpose

### **M: Message (What)**
- Define the key information you want to convey.
- **Example:**  
  "Learn how to pin, switch, and customize list views with just a few clicks."

### **A: Audience (Who)**
- Identify the target users by role, experience level, or familiarity with the product.
- **Example:**  
  "All users" or more specific segments like "beginner sales reps" or "advanced administrators."

### **P: Purpose (Why)**
- Clearly state the objective behind the message. This can help you choose the right delivery method (prompt, walkthrough, etc.).
- **Example:**  
  "Teach basic skills for list views" (for onboarding) or "Encourage use of Path and Kanban" (for feature adoption).

> **Tip:** For more effective content, tailor your message based on the user’s experience level. New users need simple, clear steps while advanced users may require deeper insights.

## 📋 Effective Content Principles (FACE)

- **Concise:** Keep messages brief to maintain focus.
- **Educational:** Provide clear instructions or tips to boost productivity.

## 🎨 Storyboarding Your User Engagement Journey
Storyboarding helps you visualize how users will interact with your guidance at different phases:

1. **Sketch the Journey:**  
   - Draw a simple wireframe for each step (e.g., onboarding prompt, feature discovery walkthrough).
   - Identify where each component (prompt, walkthrough, or welcome mat) will appear.
2. **Connect the Steps:**  
   - Use arrows to show the flow from one step to the next.
   - Ensure that each step leads logically to the next, reinforcing the "aha" moment.
3. **Identify Aha Moments:**  
   - Mark the points where the user gains key insights (lightbulb icons can represent these moments).
4. **Use Visual Aids:**  
   - Consider using Salesforce’s downloadable sketch kit or simple pen-and-paper drawings.

### **Example Storyboard Components:**
- **Step 1 (Onboarding):** Welcome mat with four options (e.g., “Take It for a Spin”, “Find Your Way Around”).
- **Step 2 (Feature Adoption):** Floating prompt titled “Get on the Path to Success” with a button labeled “Learn How”.
- **Step 3 (Help):** Quick guidance tip appearing when a user is stuck, with an option to access a detailed help document.
- **Step 4 (Deeper Learning):** Walkthrough that guides users through advanced customization features.

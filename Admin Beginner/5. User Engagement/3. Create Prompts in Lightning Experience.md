## üìå Create a Docked Prompt

While the above steps demonstrate creating a **targeted prompt**, the process for creating a **docked prompt** is similar. Remember:

- **Docked prompts** remain in a fixed position on the screen.
- They are ideal for longer messages, step-by-step instructions, or embedding multimedia content (e.g., images or videos).

*To create a docked prompt:*
1. In the In-App Guidance Builder, choose **Single Prompt**.
2. Select **Docked Prompt** instead of **Targeted Prompt**.
3. Follow the remaining steps as above:
   - Customize title, body, button labels, and scheduling.
   - Save and verify your docked prompt in the builder bar.

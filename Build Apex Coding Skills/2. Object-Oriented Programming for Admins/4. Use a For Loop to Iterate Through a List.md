## 💡 **Two Types of For Loops in Apex**

---

### 1️⃣ **Traditional For Loop**

Used when:

- You **know how many times** you want to loop.
    
- You want more **control over the loop counter**.
    

📌 **Syntax:**

```apex
for (Integer i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.debug('The number is ' + i);
}
```

🔍 **What happens:**

- Starts at `i = 0`
    
- Runs as long as `i < 5`
    
- Increments `i` by 1 each time (`i++`)
    
- Stops when `i = 5`
    

📝 **Use it when:**

- You need index-based access to a list.
    
- You’re performing an action a **fixed number of times**.
    

---

### 2️⃣ **List or Set Iteration For Loop**

Used when:

- You want to **loop through every item** in a **list** or **set**.
    
- You don’t need index numbers.
    

📌 **Syntax:**

```apex
List<String> tea = new List<String>{'Black Tea', 'Green Tea', 'Chai Tea'};
for (String t : tea) {
    System.debug('We have ' + t);
}
```

🔍 **What happens:**

- `t` holds each item in the `tea` list, one by one.
    
- The loop runs automatically for all items.
    
- Much cleaner and easier to read!
    

📝 **Use it when:**

- You’re processing **each element**.
    
- You **don’t care about the index** or position.

## 🧠 Pro Tip: Which Loop Should I Use?

|Use Case|Use This Loop|
|---|---|
|I know exactly how many times to loop|Traditional for loop|
|I’m looping through each item in a collection|Iteration for loop|
|I need access to the item's index|Traditional for loop|
|I don’t need indexes, just each value|Iteration for loop|

---

### 🚀 Want a challenge?

Try combining both types of loops like this:

```apex
List<String> tea = new List<String>{'Black Tea', 'Green Tea', 'Chai Tea'};

// Traditional loop to print index and value
for (Integer i = 0; i < tea.size(); i++) {
    System.debug('At index ' + i + ', we have: ' + tea[i]);
}

// Iteration loop to just print the tea types
for (String t : tea) {
    System.debug('We have ' + t);
}
```

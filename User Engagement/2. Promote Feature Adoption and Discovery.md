## üîç Types of Prompts

Prompts come in three flavors. Choose the type based on your message length, desired placement, and whether you need persistent guidance.

### 1. **Floating Prompt**
- **Characteristics:**
  - Nonintrusive, appears in one of nine preset positions (top left, top center, top right, middle left, middle center, middle right, bottom left, bottom center, bottom right).
  - Ideal for driving users to a resource (e.g., training PDF or website).
  - Good for short messages with a call-to-action button.
- **Use Case Example:**  
  Informing users they can pin a favorite list view to boost productivity.

### 2. **Targeted Prompt**
- **Characteristics:**
  - Similar to a floating prompt but anchored to a specific page element.
  - Provides context by pointing directly at the feature.
  - Best for messages that require acknowledgment of a particular UI element.
- **Use Case Example:**  
  Highlighting a newly added button or feature on a record page.

### 3. **Docked Prompt**
- **Characteristics:**
  - Remains in place as the user navigates the app.
  - Ideal for longer messages or embedded content (e.g., videos, multi-sentence instructions).
  - Useful for ongoing reference, such as step-by-step instructions.
- **Use Case Example:**  
  Displaying a header with an embedded video and bullet points about a new account record layout.
